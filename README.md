# What is Requirement Analysis?

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

## .Requirement Gathering (Elicitation):

Collecting requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and documentation review.

Identifying both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.).

## .Requirement Modeling:

Using diagrams (use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, ER diagrams) and models to represent requirements visually.

Helps simplify complex requirements for clarity and validation.

## .Documentation:

Creating detailed documents like the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), use cases, and user stories.

These documents become the official reference for design and development.

## .Requirement Validation:

Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, feasible, consistent, and testable.

Reviewing with stakeholders to confirm that the documented requirements truly reflect their needs.

## .Requirement Prioritization:

Ranking requirements based on business value, urgency, and feasibility.

Ensures that critical features are delivered first and resources are allocated effectively.

## .Defines Project Scope Clearly:

Establishes boundaries for what the system will and won’t do, reducing the risk of scope creep.

## .Minimizes Errors and Rework:

Early identification and correction of unclear or conflicting requirements prevent costly fixes later in development.

## .Improves Communication:

Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the technical team, ensuring mutual understanding.

## .Supports Better Design and Development:

A well-defined set of requirements provides a clear roadmap for designers and developers to build the system.

## .Facilitates Testing and Validation:

Test cases and acceptance criteria are derived directly from the requirements, ensuring the final product meets expectations.

Ensures Customer Satisfaction:

By capturing stakeholders’ real needs accurately, the final software product is more likely to satisfy business goals and user expectations.
