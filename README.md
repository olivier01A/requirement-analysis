# What is Requirement Analysis?

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

## .Requirement Gathering (Elicitation):

Collecting requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and documentation review.

Identifying both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.).

## .Requirement Modeling:

Using diagrams (use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, ER diagrams) and models to represent requirements visually.

Helps simplify complex requirements for clarity and validation.

## .Documentation:

Creating detailed documents like the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), use cases, and user stories.

These documents become the official reference for design and development.

## .Requirement Validation:

Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, feasible, consistent, and testable.

Reviewing with stakeholders to confirm that the documented requirements truly reflect their needs.

## .Requirement Prioritization:

Ranking requirements based on business value, urgency, and feasibility.

Ensures that critical features are delivered first and resources are allocated effectively.

# Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

## .Defines Project Scope Clearly:

Establishes boundaries for what the system will and won’t do, reducing the risk of scope creep.

## .Minimizes Errors and Rework:

Early identification and correction of unclear or conflicting requirements prevent costly fixes later in development.

## .Improves Communication:

Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the technical team, ensuring mutual understanding.

## .Supports Better Design and Development:

A well-defined set of requirements provides a clear roadmap for designers and developers to build the system.

## .Facilitates Testing and Validation:

Test cases and acceptance criteria are derived directly from the requirements, ensuring the final product meets expectations.

Ensures Customer Satisfaction:

By capturing stakeholders’ real needs accurately, the final software product is more likely to satisfy business goals and user expectations.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

## 1. Defines Clear Project Scope and Objectives

Requirement Analysis ensures that stakeholders’ needs and expectations are accurately gathered and documented.

This clarity prevents scope creep (uncontrolled changes or additions), keeping the project focused and aligned with business goals.

A well-defined scope also helps developers, testers, and managers understand exactly what needs to be built.

## 2. Improves Communication Between Stakeholders

It acts as a bridge between clients, end-users, and the development team.

By documenting requirements through models, specifications, and use cases, it ensures that all parties share the same understanding of the system.

This reduces misunderstandings and minimizes rework later in the project.

## 3. Reduces Development Costs and Time

Detecting and correcting requirement errors early is far less expensive than fixing them during coding or after deployment.

With well-analyzed requirements, developers build the right features the first time, avoiding wasted resources.

This leads to better time management, optimized resource allocation, and cost savings.

✅ In summary: Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC because it sets a clear direction, ensures stakeholder alignment, and prevents costly mistakes.
